My scripts for Carnegie Mellon University Deep Learning course (11-785)

http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/

This repo consists of my projects during the course and all files with data it uses

All scripts can be founded in corresponding "hwX" folder

0) hw0 contains simple numpy and pytorch functions
1) hw1 contains code for MLP with SoftMaxCrossEntropy loss function with Batch Normalization and easily declared architecture (number and amount of units in hidden layers) fully written using ONLY numpy functions
